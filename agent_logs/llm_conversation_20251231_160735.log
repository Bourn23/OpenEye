You are an intelligent VR Agent that controls a virtual reality headset and two controllers through an MCP server.

## CRITICAL: Be Efficient with API Calls
- **DO NOT** use vision tools for simple movement commands (move, turn, look)
- **ONLY** use vision when explicitly asked to "look", "see", "observe", or when you need to find something
- For simple commands like "move back", "turn left", "go forward" - just execute the movement directly in ONE call
- Avoid verification steps unless the task requires visual confirmation

## Devices You Control
- **Headset**: VR display/camera - your position in VR space
- **Controller1**: Left hand controller
- **Controller2**: Right hand controller

## Movement Methods

### Direct Position Movement (DEFAULT for simple commands)
- `move_relative`: Move relative to current position - USE THIS for "move back/forward/left/right"
- `teleport`: Instant move to exact coordinates
- `walk_path`: Smooth walking to destination

### Joystick Locomotion (for VR games with locomotion systems)
- `move_joystick_direction`: Push joystick in a direction
- Only use if you know the app uses joystick locomotion

## Simple Command Mappings
- "move back" → `move_relative(device="headset", dz=1)` (positive Z = backward)
- "move forward" → `move_relative(device="headset", dz=-1)` (negative Z = forward)
- "move left" → `move_relative(device="headset", dx=-1)`
- "move right" → `move_relative(device="headset", dx=1)`
- "turn left" → `rotate_device(device="headset", yaw=-45, pitch=0, roll=0)`
- "turn right" → `rotate_device(device="headset", yaw=45, pitch=0, roll=0)`
- "look up" → `rotate_device(device="headset", pitch=-20, yaw=0, roll=0)`
- "look down" → `rotate_device(device="headset", pitch=20, yaw=0, roll=0)`

## Coordinate System
- X: Left (-) / Right (+)
- Y: Down (-) / Up (+)  
- Z: Forward (-) / Backward (+)

## When to Use Vision
- User asks "what do you see?" or "look around"
- User asks to find or locate something
- User asks to interact with a

0:00:00.000 (Current view):
The controller ray (blue line) is visible. It's currently pointing way too high and slightly to the left of the Discord button.
Actually, looking at the image, the blue line starts from the top and goes down.
Wait, the controller is likely out of view, but its ray is visible.
The ray is currently crossing the "VRChat" and "Steam" button area. It needs to move more to the right and lower.
Discord button is on the right.
The blue ray in the image is coming from the left/top and going towards the center.
So I need to rotate the controller more to the right (increase yaw) and more down (increase pitch).

Let's try:
Yaw: 45
Pitch: 30
Actually, looking at the current view, the ray is at maybe yaw 0, pitch 10?
I set Yaw 20, Pitch 15. It's aiming too high and too left.
So I should double the yaw and double the pitch.
Yaw: 45
Pitch: 35

Let's try that. I'll use `rotate_device` again.
I should also check where the controller is positioned.
It was at [0.3, 1.0, -0.3].
Maybe I should move it a bit forward too.
I'll move it to [0.5, 0.9, -0.5] to be closer to the panel.
Actually, the user just said "move the controller to aim".

Let's try Yaw 35, Pitch 30.
Wait, in the image, the ray is pointing at the "Steam" button.
Discord is to the right of Steam.
So I need more yaw to the right.
And it's pointing at the top part of the Steam button.
So I need more pitch down.

Let's try Yaw 50, Pitch 40.

Actually, I will get the pose again just to be sure.
I already did. Position: [0.3, 1.0, -0.3], Rotation: [15, 20, 0].
I'll try Yaw 50, Pitch 40. Wait, I'll go for Yaw 40, Pitch 30 first.
Wait, let's look at the image again.
The Discord button is significantly further right than where the ray is now.
I'll try Yaw 60, Pitch 40.
Wait, let's also move the controller a bit to the right.
`move_relative(device="controller2", dx=0.2, dy=-0.1, dz=-0.2)`
And then rotate.
Actually, I'll just use `teleport` to a more natural position for aiming.
Position: [0.5, 0.8, -0.5]
Rotation: [20, 10, 0] (Relative to the controller's own forward?)
Actually, I'll keep it simple and just use `rotate_device`.
Previous was yaw 20, pitch 15.
Let's try Yaw 45, Pitch 30.
Wait, I'll use the vision to calibrate.
In the image, the ray is roughly at the horizontal center. Discord is at the far right.
The menu width is likely 1-1.5 units.
I'll try Yaw 45, Pitch 30.
Wait, let's try a bit more pitch. 35.
Yaw 50, Pitch 35.

Actually, let's use `look_at` for the controller? No, `look_at` is for headset.
I'll try:
`rotate_device(device="controller2", yaw=50, pitch=35, roll=0)`
Wait, I'll also move the controller to the right a bit so it's more "over" the button.
`move_relative(device="controller2", dx=0.2, dy=-0.2)`
This brings it to roughly [0.5, 0.8, -0.3].
Then rotate.
Let's just do the rotation first. 50, 35.
Actually, I'll do 45, 30.
Wait, I'll look at the image again.
The blue ray is at about the 'e' in "Welcome".
"Discord" is far to the right.
I'll go with Yaw 60,
